If you receive the following warning when launching the game on newer PCs with plenty of system resources (powerful CPU, lots of RAM, etc):

![Insufficient resources error]({{ "/assets/images/posts/192_exNOrY_tribes_v_error.png" | relative_url }})

You can fix it by editing the `TV_CD_DVD.ini` file (full path in my case `Tribes Revengeance\Tribes Vengeance\Program\Bin\TV_CD_DVD.ini`) and changing:


```ini
RequireMinSpec=True
```

To:

```ini
RequireMinSpec=False
```

After consulting expert and savior [jackfuste](http://www.wsgf.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=31072) from [wide screen gaming forum (WSGF)](http://www.wsgf.org/), the technical reason this happens is:

> As for error, it's happened because the programmer used "signed int" data type.
> "signed int" data type have range of values from â€“2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 and this is not enough to store the value of video memory, since modern videocards haves more that 2GB of video memory.

Hope this helps!
