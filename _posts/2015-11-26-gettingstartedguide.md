Do you prefer using your old out-of-the-box copy of Tribes Vengeance? No problem! Simply follow the steps below to get rocking!

1. Install the game as you normally would, including entering the valid CD-Key you have
2. Download the correct patch for your game. There is an English version and a German Version. You can find the patches on [This page]({{ "/downloads/miscellaneous/" | relative_url }})
3. Download the updated Engine.dll and replace it in your **Program/Bin** folder. You can find the updated Engine.dll on [This page]({{ "/downloads/revengeance/" | relative_url }})
4. Install the correct community made map packs, so that you can join any server! You will need the BEML Map Packs 4 to 8, the VM map pack and the Miscellaneous Map Pack. You can find all these maps [HERE]({{ "/downloads/maps/" | relative_url }})
5. Start up the game and create a new player profile in the multiplayer tab. Go to the Servers tab and should no servers show, wait **at least** one minute and try refreshing

NOTE: As you will know, the game does not have the console activated or any tweak applied, as it is an out-of-the-box version. For help on increasing game performance or playing experience, visit our [TutorialS]({{ "/tutorials/" | relative_url }}).
