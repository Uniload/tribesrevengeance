# Installing skins 

* * *

This guide will explain how to install skins in Tribes Vengeance.

  

Before explaining how to install the skins, it is important to know that Tribes Vengeance has two types of skins: playermodelskins and weaponskins. Furthermore, it is also important to note that only those, who installed the exact same skin packages, can actually see the skin you have equiped.

To install and activate playermodelskins, please follow these steps:

1. **[download]({{ "/downloads/skins/" | relative_url }})** the playermodelskins you would like to have

2. If the file you downloaded is an executable file, **enter** your `.../VUGames/Tribes Vengeance` folder

    If the file you downloaded is a zipped file, **extract** the file to your `.../VUGames/Tribes Vengeance/Content/Skins` folder

3. Go ingame and join a server to your liking
4. Go to a permanent inventory station and select the skin to your liking
  

To install and activate weaponskins, please follow these steps:

1. **[download]({{ "/downloads/skins/" | relative_url }})** the playermodelskins you would like to have

2. If the file you downloaded is an executable file, **enter** your `.../VUGames/Tribes Vengeance` folder

    If the file you downloaded is a zipped file, **extract** the `.pkg` files to your `.../VUGames/Tribes Vengeance/Content/Art` folder and the `.ini` file to your `.../VUGames/Tribes Vengeance/Program/Bin` folder

3. Go ingame and **open** the console
4. Type the following: `exec dice.ini`
5. 
    ![]({{ "/assets/images/posts/installmods1.jpg" | relative_url }})
5. Join a gameserver to your liking

NOTE: It is required to retype the above into the console everytime you start up the game, if you want them activated.
