On this page you will find out how to change your windowed mode resolution.

  

To do so, please follow these steps:

- 

1. Navigate to your **...\VUGames\Tribes Vengeance\Program\Bin** folder and find " **TV\_CD\_DVD.ini**".

- 

2. Open it with a text-editor like notepad. Use **CTRL + F** to find: "**[WinDrv.WindowsClient]**".

- 

3. Underneath that term you will find 4 lines. Two of them have a X and two of them have a Y at the end of their names. The X stands for the width of your resolution, whereas the Y stands for the height of your resolution.

- 

4. Choose the resolution values. For example:

    **[WinDrv.WindowsClient]
                       				WindowedViewportX=1920
    						WindowedViewportY=1080
    						FullscreenViewportX=1920
    						FullscreenViewportY=1080**

Note this is completely analog to the declaration used in the first method.
