On this page you will find out how to enable the windowed mode.

  

In order to enable windowed mode, you must follow these steps:

1. **Find** or **create** a shortcut of your `TV_CD_DVD.exe`
2. **Rightclick** the shortcut
3. **Modify** the **target field** , by adding " `-windowed`" in the back (mind the whitespace)
  

So for example you get the following: `"C:\Program Files\VUGames\Tribes Vengeance\Program\Bin\TV\_CD\_DVD.exe" -windowed`

  

TIP: To enable both windowed mode, as console, you can add -console and -windowed to the target field. (mind the whitespaces!)

So for example you get the following: `"C:\Program Files\VUGames\Tribes Vengeance\Program\Bin\TV\_CD\_DVD.exe" -console -windowed`
